## About The Project

Quiz App was developed for any anyone who wants to improve his/her IT knowledge by practicing.

It is a user-friendly app. The only thing you need is to select an option that you suppose is a correct answer.

The app doesn't allow you to pass the next question unless you select an option for the current question.

If you don't have any idea regarding a specific question, by clicking on 'See Answer button you can see the correct option.

Be careful, if you cheat any question you forfeit that one, and your overall score would decrease.

At the end of your quiz, you are going to face the result page. On the right-hand side you see your wrong answers, on the right-hand side, you see correct answers.
